   - Integration of the PLM VADECUM database.
   - Medication and dose tracking system.
   - Customized reminders and notifications.
   - Development of a secure platform for sensitive medical data.

6. *Project Limitations:*
   - No medical advice or diagnoses provided.
   - Accuracy depends on the PLM VADECUM database.
   - Does not replace medical consultation for serious conditions.

## Phase 2: Strategic Changes

### Evidenced Changes:

1. *Transition of Development Tools:*
   - Shift from Flutterflow and Android Studio to NetBeans and IntelliJ.
   - Implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

2. *Refined and Focused Requirements:*
   - Consolidation of project requirements into six key tasks.
   - Increased focus on critical and valuable features for users.

3. *Strategic Redesign of Software Structure:*
   - Modularization of class and use case diagrams for improved readability.
   - Adaptation of structure for better understanding, scalability, and future enhancements.

4. *Implementation of the MVC Pattern:*
   - Adoption of the Model-View-Controller pattern for clearer responsibilities.
   - Promising demonstration of code structure and management.

## Phase 3: Additional Adjustments and Refinements

### Evidenced Changes:

1. *Change in IDE and Prototyping Approach:*
   - Shift from Android Studio to Java and NetBeans for desktop prototyping.
   - Selection of Java and Swing for a robust and interactive user interface.

2. *Adjustments in Data Management:*
   - Initial use of H2 for testing, with a preference for a cloud-based relational database.
   - Consideration of SQLite for user-specific medication data.

3. *Preference for Cloud Database:*
   - Emphasis on a cloud-based relational database for scalable and accessible storage.
   - SQLite for local storage of user-specific medication lists.

4. *Optimization of User Experience:*
   - Choice of Java and Swing for an intuitive and efficient development experience.
   - Focus on a smooth and efficient development process to meet project deadlines.

In the initial phase, the primary goal of the "Medication Management System" was to enhance the user experience in medication administration, ensuring accurate information and timely reminders. It focused on providing efficient access to crucial medication details, comprehensive historical records, and personalized reminders. The integration of the extensive PLM VADECUM database ensured up-to-date information on various medications. However, significant limitations were highlighted, such as the lack of medical advice and dependence on the accuracy of the PLM VADECUM database.

In the second phase, significant changes in development strategy were observed. There was evident transition in development tools, abandoning Flutterflow and Android Studio in favor of NetBeans and IntelliJ under the MVC pattern. The project requirements list was refined, focusing on six key tasks to simplify management and concentrate on critical features. Additionally, the MVC pattern was implemented to enhance the software structure, making it more understandable and scalable.

In the most recent phase, the strategic decision to switch to Java and NetBeans for desktop prototyping marked a significant turn in development. This change was based on the perception of NetBeans as a more intuitive and accessible option, with the goal of ensuring a smoother and more efficient development experience, given the project's time pressure and the learning curve associated with Android Studio. Additionally, H2 was considered for initial database testing, though there was a preference for a cloud-based relational database for scalable and accessible storage.

The changes throughout the phases demonstrate a continuous adaptation in the "Medication Management System" development strategy. From optimizing tools to refining requirements and adjusting data management, each modification has been guided by the pursuit of a more efficient and user-centric solution. These changes reinforce the team's commitment to constant improvement and delivering an innovative and effective medication management system.
