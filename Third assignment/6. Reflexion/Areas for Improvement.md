# Areas for improvement

During the Object-Oriented Programming course with Professor Edgar Cambranes, we encountered various dynamics that led us to perceive the course in a unique way, different from what one might consider conventional. Despite the positive practical application, it is important to note other aspects that could benefit from a critical and constructive perspective.

One point that prompted reflection was the nature of the instructional materials used. While the inclusion of theoretical concepts was appreciated, in some instances, the clarity and accessibility of the presented material could have been improved. The complexity of certain topics and the lack of concrete examples at times hindered the assimilation of information, potentially leaving some students with doubts or confusion.

In this regard, there is a suggestion to pay closer attention to the structuring of instructional materials, seeking ways to simplify complex concepts and provide examples that enhance understanding. Exploring the possibility of incorporating additional resources, such as interactive tutorials or more detailed practical exercises, could reinforce learning and address various learning modalities.

Furthermore, although the question-and-answer dynamics are positively highlighted, it was observed that in some instances, the communication between the professor and students could have been more fluid. Openness to questions and continuous feedback is crucial for the learning process, and fostering an environment where students feel comfortable expressing their concerns could significantly contribute to the understanding and application of taught concepts.

In summary, while we acknowledge the positive practical application and the question-and-answer dynamics in the course, the review and improvement of instructional materials, as well as the promotion of more open communication, could further enrich the educational experience. This critical perspective aims not only to point out potential areas of improvement but also to underscore the importance of continually strengthening the quality of the course for the benefit of all students.
