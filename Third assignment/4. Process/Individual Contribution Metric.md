## Segunda Entrega

The DoseWize project team has progressed through various phases, encompassing planning for the transition to Java and NetBeans, research on Java and Swing for UI prototyping, and investigation of cloud-based relational databases. Subsequently, the team engaged in documentation activities, including changes in functional and non-functional requirements, finalizing research on Android technologies, and summarizing functional and non-functional requirements. Further, documentation and coding activities involved the creation of databases, coding in Java, and preparing for the app's functionality. The team worked on manual data entry, repository organization on GitHub, and connecting the database to the application, demonstrating a comprehensive and systematic approach to project development.

## Tercera Entrega
The DoseWize project advanced through phases including planning for Java and NetBeans transition, research on Java and Swing for UI prototyping, and investigation of cloud-based relational databases. Activities involved implementing class abstraction in Java, refining product descriptions, and conducting initial testing with the H2 database. The team focused on integrating the MVC pattern in Java, refining process descriptions, and prioritizing non-functional requirements. Further, they prepared for progress presentations, finalized H2 database testing, and prototyped the user interface in Java. Bug fixing, optimization, and prioritization of new requirements followed, leading to documentation finalization, project completion report, and final presentation preparation in Java. The team engaged in reflective reviews, celebration events, and task assignments for December, covering UI design refinement and database integration planning. Subsequent activities included code implementation, testing of UI improvements, and the implementation of a cloud-based database. The team concluded with debugging, code optimization, collaboration meetings for code review, user testing, and integration of user feedback, finalizing code changes, UI improvements, and database integration.
