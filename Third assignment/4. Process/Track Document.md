## First Delivery
In this initial progress update for the DoseWize project, there is evident advancement in the execution of activities by each team member. Collaboration and dedication are reflected in the graphical visualization, highlighting individual and collective contributions at each stage.

The team began by establishing the general and specific objectives of the project, addressing both the background and initial organization on GitHub. Additionally, a daily activity log was maintained. In the development of requirements, progress was made in defining functional and non-functional requirements, with advancements in product description, process, and associated artifacts. Requirement prioritization and class abstraction stand out as essential milestones, supported by progress presentations and daily record-keeping.

Completion of both functional and non-functional requirements, as well as their prioritization, was achieved. Class abstraction remained a key task, complemented by the finalization of descriptions and progress presentations. Work on organizing artifacts was also highlighted. The last recorded date shows a focus on class abstraction, progress presentation, and artifact finalization. Dedication to these activities indicates an advanced phase of the project. The graphical visualization provides a clear representation of how each team member has contributed over time, showing the evolution and impact of their efforts in various project stages.

## Second Delivery
During the second phase of the DoseWize project, the team has experienced significant progress, with strategic planning led by Raul Alejandro Magaña Flores being a notable highlight. This included transitioning to Java and NetBeans, along with substantial changes in the project's functional and non-functional requirements. Jimena Guadalupe García Ríos has made significant contributions by conducting key research on Android technologies, providing a solid foundation for development decisions.

In terms of coding and documentation activities, the team has progressed efficiently. The database creation was initiated through web scraping, and the Java application coding began. Additionally, SQLite was chosen as the database, and improvements were made to the class and use case diagrams. These efforts have laid a solid foundation for the project's continuous development.

Jesús Mateo Ortiz Chay led the exploration of cloud database solutions, emphasizing concerns about data scalability and accessibility. The successful approval of the first CRUD in the sprint review reflects the team's tangible progress. Furthermore, preparations for new CRUDs and the initiative to connect the database to the application demonstrate a practical approach to technical implementation.

In summary, the DoseWize development team has demonstrated a firm commitment and effective collaboration, addressing challenges and collectively moving towards project success.

## Third Delivery
Throughout the activities carried out, significant progress has been made in the development of the DoseWize project. Each team member has contributed integrally in different areas, demonstrating a collaborative and specialized approach. Below is a summary of activities without dates and organized by paragraphs:

The team began with the transition to Java and NetBeans, planning this migration and evaluating the necessary tools for development. Exhaustive research on Java and Swing for UI prototyping was conducted, and options for cloud-based relational databases were explored to ensure scalability and accessibility. This initial phase laid the groundwork for subsequent development.

The implementation of class abstraction in Java proceeded, simultaneously refining the product description and conducting initial tests with the H2 database. The integration of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in Java proved to be a crucial milestone in structured code management. Preparation for progress presentation in Java and the completion of artifacts supported the steady development progress.

The team focused efforts on testing and prototyping, both on H2 and SQLite, to ensure product functionality and customization. Prioritization of non-functional requirements and artifact completion for implementation in Java contributed to consolidating project efficiency.

The final phase included optimization and bug fixes in Java, along with documentation completion and preparation for the presentation. A reflective review of the code, project completion report, and preparation for the final presentation took place. A team celebration event marked the project's closure.

In December, specific tasks were assigned for planning the next development cycle. Code implementations, UI improvements, and the planned integration of a cloud database were carried out. Emphasis was placed on testing, user feedback analysis, and collaboration to review and improve the code.

The completion of code changes, UI improvements, and database integration marked the successful closure of the project. The team's dedication and collaboration are reflected in the graphical visualization, highlighting individual and collective contributions at each stage of the DoseWize project.
