# Software Product Development Process: Medication Management System

## **Phase 1: Tools Assessment and Transition to Java/NetBeans:**
In the initial phase, the team focused on evaluating development tools. The key decision was to shift from Android Studio to Java/NetBeans for the desktop prototype, prioritizing efficiency and a manageable learning curve.

## **Phase 2: Interface Design and Data Management:**
The second phase was dedicated to exploring alternatives for the user interface, testing data management with H2, and analyzing database options. The final choice leaned towards Java/Swing and cloud-based databases for scalability and accessibility.

## **Phase 3: Process Enhancement and Documentation:**
In this intermediate phase, the team aimed to review and enhance the current development process. A more fluid and efficient approach was sought, and requirements documentation was streamlined and consolidated into key tasks.

## **Phase 4: Implementation and Training:**
The primary objective of this phase was the implementation of SQLite to enhance data management. Additionally, a training session in Java/NetBeans was conducted to bolster the team's proficiency with the newly selected tools.

## **Phase 5: Testing and Renewed Commitment:**
The final phase focused on planning tests with H2, evaluating cloud storage alternatives, and addressing specific challenges in the implementation of Java/NetBeans. The phase concluded with a review of the team's commitment and a renewed focus on project deadlines.
