## Day Summary:
Today marked the official start of the software development project. The team gathered to kick off the first Sprint of the project. Roles and responsibilities of each team member were discussed.

In the Sprint Planning Meeting, the overall project objective was defined, and the initial product backlog was created. It was decided to start with documentation activities:
1. Importance or relevance of the proposal
2. Project scope and limitations
3. Identification of ineffective ideas, functions, and features
4. Definition of functional and non-functional requirements

During the discussion, the team conducted the first Daily Scrum. Roles and responsibilities of each team member were discussed, and meeting schedules were agreed upon.

A Sprint Review was not conducted as the first product increment is not ready yet.

In the Sprint Retrospective, the team discussed roles and the need to work as a cohesive team, agreeing to improve communication among team members.

**For the next Sprint:**

 - Continue defining functional and non-functional requirements.
 - Research similar software products.
