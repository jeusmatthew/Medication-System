# Evolution of functional requirements

Initially, the development team defined an ambitious set of 30 functional requirements (RF) to cover a wide range of capabilities in version 1.0 of the DoseWize mobile application for medication administration. These requirements were thoroughly documented after an initial project was implemented in software engineering fundamentals to understand the most pressing needs of the target users. Additionally, the team conducted extensive research on other leading medical treatment management applications to map standard functionalities and key market differentiators.

The initial functional requirements (RF) would allow users to easily add their medications, either through search or detailed manual input to customize schedules and specific doses for each medication if necessary. The application would generate reminder alarms for each dose and display relevant information about precautions and interactions to keep patients safe. Additionally, the ability to record symptoms and side effects would enable reporting for doctors, while controlled medication deletion and a full reset would provide flexibility. Finally, considering mobile phone use, proper support for horizontal orientation and readability was taken into account.

While the scope was, from a perspective, large, the estimated delivery date also posed a significant challenge. Midway through the development of version 1.0, the team was notably behind with a progress of only 35% considering the remaining user stories vs. the available time. After a thorough evaluation, and understanding that it would not be possible to deliver all committed capabilities without significantly increasing the available team and budget, the decision was made to reconsider the scope of this first version for the remaining 6 weeks of the project. The goal was to define a reduced set of RF that would deliver core functionality robustly and with high quality, postponing additional capabilities for future versions when more resources would be available.

The new reduced version would thus focus on only 6 essential functional requirements (RF) that were reprioritized in conjunction with the client based on their importance to the initial audience and to facilitate the adoption of the application. For instance, the search and manual entry of medications were simplified in favor of expediting the core functions of reminders and alarms for fixed doses. In this way, in version 1.0, users can now easily add their medications, schedule doses in an integrated calendar, receive reminder alarms, and access relevant information for each medication, thereby fulfilling the application's primary value proposition.

While additional features such as symptom recording, deletion confirmations, and a full reset were postponed, a minimal record of the medications used was retained to pave the way for building incrementally upon this strong foundation.

## Updated functional Requirements 

| ID   | Requirement Description                                             | MoSCoW Priority   |

| RF-2 | The system should provide detailed information about each medication, including precautions, possible side effects, and medication interactions. | Must |
| RF-3 | The program will create alarms for oral medication dosages through the calendar. It should execute a visual display and produce an alarming sound when the alarm is triggered. Users should be able to click on a date on the calendar to view complete details of scheduled doses for that day. | Must |
| RF-4 | The system must display medication names clearly and legibly. The application should be compatible with Windows devices. Buttons, interactive elements, charts, and data tables should adapt to horizontal orientation to maintain functionality and usability. | Must |
| RF-5 | The system must allow users to remove a medication from the list of scheduled medications. Removing a medication should require user confirmation to prevent accidental deletions. There should also be an option to remove all medications from the list for a complete reset. | Must |

This reduction also responded to various factors:

1. **Time and team limitations:** Limited resources and time constraints to meet deadlines
2. **Lack of early information:** Insufficient information early on regarding functionalities of greatest value to users
3. **Unforeseen challenges:** Unexpected obstacles in development to meet all initial RF
4. **Risks in quality and adoption:** Concerns about overloading the application and its impact on quality and user adoption

The final decision was grounded in best practices for agile software development, where incremental building allows for early feedback from real users to understand their needs and gradually incorporate features based on demand and importance in future development cycles. This first reduced version will establish a solid foundation for informed product growth, connecting with real users from the start to validate hypotheses and strategically complement the scope.


In conclusion, this scope reduction aligns with a user-focused strategy, prioritizing simplicity, ease of use, and essential benefits from the beginning, even if the visionary set of functionalities originally planned for the first version could not be fully achieved due to legitimate resource and time constraints. The initial version will serve as a springboard to reach greater heights in future iterations, relying on the same users who adopt the tool from the beginning to continuously and substantively incorporate only what truly adds value and improves their quality of life, achieving a truly user-centered experience along the way.

# Evolution of non functional requirements

The original set of non-functional requirements represented an ambitious first pass at defining system qualities and constraints. However, as the project unfolded, it became clear that some of the initial targets were unrealistic or needed adjustment.

The initial NFRs covered various quality attributes expected for the mobile application in the product, organizational, and external dimensions. For example, compatibility with Android devices, agile response times, data reliability, and integration with external health systems.

In our relentless pursuit of industry standards and with the best intentions in mind, a set of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) was initially established to reflect the aspirations and goals of our project. These NFRs embodied the ideals we sought to achieve in terms of quality, performance, and security. However, as we progressed in development, we encountered a series of practical constraints that made it impossible to fully meet all the initially set NFRs.

Project constraints, such as time limitations, resource constraints, and specific technological challenges, have significantly influenced our ability to achieve certain initially proposed objectives. Despite our unwavering efforts, we acknowledge that the reality of software development often imposes unexpected challenges that impact the complete implementation of NFRs.

In this context, we present the Modified and Final Non-Functional Requirements, which reflect a conscious adaptation to project conditions. These revised NFRs represent a evolution balance between our original aspirations and the limitations of the development environment. While some ideal goals may have been adjusted, our priority remains delivering a robust and functional end product that meets acceptable quality standards in practice.

The modified set of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) underscores our ability to effectively adapt to project realities while maintaining an ongoing commitment to delivering a product that satisfies essential user needs and quality expectations. Through this conscious evolution of non-functional requirements, we aim to ensure that the final product is not only viable within the project context but also efficient, secure, and capable of providing a satisfactory experience for end-users.

One key area that underwent changes was the reliability of the product. The initial requirements called for incorporating at least 90% of all medications available in Mexico. However, attempting to catalog the vast range of branded and generic offerings across the entire country proved unfeasible within the project's scope and budget. Therefore, this was adjusted to focus on maintaining extensive but not completely exhaustive coverage.

Relatedly, the goal of obtaining explicit permissions from pharmaceutical companies for 99% of entries had to be scaled back. The legal and administrative barriers to securing this level of formal approval across thousands of organizations proved impractical. So while care is still taken to ensure the inclusion of trade names adheres to fair use standards, explicit pre-approval is no longer uniformly required.

On the technical side, efficiency targets were overestimated in the initial drafting. The goal of 5 seconds or less load times could not consistently be met, especially for first-time users whose local device cache was still cold. And processing 500 search results per second exceeded realistic capacity. These were accordingly adjusted to focus less on absolute speed and more on relative optimization and responsiveness.

In hindsight, the case of the RNF-6 (Original) clearly illustrates an overestimation of its capabilities by claiming to process 500 search results per second. While such high rates may seem ideal in theory, practical implementation would have required complex data structures and asynchronous programming, consuming a significant amount of time and demanding extensive testing.

Given that the application is specifically designed for individual users and is not intended to meet the needs of pharmaceutical companies with large traffic volumes, a conscious decision was made to set the processing limit at default. No resources were allocated to optimize the system for full execution times, as there was no need to cater to massive user demand or meet enterprise requirements in this particular context. This approach allowed prioritizing a seamless experience for individual users without investing resources in areas that were non-essential for the application's functionality.

Similarly, the initial call for a complete regulatory validation as a medical device was adjusted. Achieving regulatory compliance involves a complex process of official paperwork, licenses, and certificates approving something related to the healthcare field. Therefore, priority was given to following development best practices, with the option to generalize all these regulations for educational purposes in the comprehensive development of our project.

Therefore, this requirement was adjusted to focus on adhering to fair use standards, utilizing reference data from public sources, and securing permissions when easily available, instead of requiring universal formal approval. This balances copyright compliance with development practicality.

The final changes sought to balance the original aspirations with practical limitations to deliver a set of realistic and achievable Requirements and Functionalities (RNFs). This approach allows for launching a viable first version of the application and laying the groundwork for progressive improvements in the future.

This flexibility to recalibrate expectations and identify intermediate solutions has been essential for the project's success thus far and will continue to guide design decisions for the benefit of patients who can most benefit from the personalized medication control enabled by this initial functional iteration of the application.

These specific objectives are crucial for developing MediCare Calendar and ensuring it serves as a comprehensive and effective tool for managing medical treatments and promoting better health.

Specifically, the overarching goal of facilitating medical treatment management and improving adherence is preserved as a central focus through the requirements prioritization process. The initial set of 30 functional requirements was certainly ambitious in seeking to deliver an exhaustive range of capabilities to comprehensively meet user needs. However, the revised condensed list of 6 "must have" requirements continues to directly address the core application objectives.

For instance, simplified abilities to add medications, set schedules, and configure reminders and alarms still provide versions of the most vital functionalities called for in objectives 2, 3 and 4. Allowing users to easily log their treatments, receive customized reminders, and prevent missed doses enhances adherence. Additionally, continuing to supply medication details and precautions serves objective 5 regarding informed health decisions.

While extra features like symptom trackers are now designated as optional, they demonstrate retained ambition to empower patients with tools promoting better outcomes. So the essence of the goals is preserved, even if the initial vision could not be actualized in full at the present development stage.

Crucially, the streamlined requirements meet the overarching aim to develop an application enabling treatment management. The consolidated must-have capabilities deliver a Minimum Viable Product centered on usability and core benefits, providing the foundation for incremental enhancements responsive to real user feedback. In this way, the simplified functionality sets the stage for eventually meeting more advanced objectives as well.

In summary, the focused requirements deliver streamlined but impactful functionality fulfilling the most pressing user needs identified in early discovery and validation. While concessions were made to project limitations, the fundamentals remain intact through emphasis on facilitating treatment adherence via reminders and information. The possibilities forfeited for now remain guiding ideals toward which to aspire through iterative improvement.

By embracing agile development processes, the requirements evolution positions the product to frequently re-calibrate based on user inputs over time. The initially envisioned comprehensive set of capabilities can progressively materialize across more incremental delivery cycles. So this solid baseline aligned with key goals marks the starting point on a responsive path toward the full original vision.

The flexibility demonstrated in the requirements revision process thus showcases commitment to upholding core application objectives. DoseWize as currently specified retains focus on treatment management, reminders, information, and adoption through a streamlined but high-quality initial user experience. Future releases can build progressively upon this foundation aligned with purpose. So while scope was reduced to match constraints, the essence of intent persists in driving development priorities now and for enhancements to come.
