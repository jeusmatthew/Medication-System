# Software Product Development Process: Medication Management System
## **Phase 1: Project Initiation**

**1. Definition of Objectives:** The Scrum Master (Raul Magaña) leads the identification of project objectives, focusing on the creation of the Medication Management System.
**2. Team Formation:** A development team is formed with Raul Magaña, Mateo Ortiz, and Jimena Garcia, each possessing complementary technical skills to address all aspects of development.
**3. Creation of Product Backlog:** The team, under the guidance of the Scrum Master, begins to create the product backlog, identifying key functionalities and features necessary for the system.

## **Phase 2: Planning and Scrum Adaptation**

**4. Sprints and Duration:** The team decides that Sprints will have a duration of two weeks, considered suitable for the project.

**5. Daily Standup Meetings:** A daily meeting is established for the team, where each member shares updates on their work and discusses any impediments.

## **Phase 3: Sprint Execution**
**6. Sprint Planning Meeting:** At the start of each Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint planning meeting. Since there is no Product Owner, the team collaborates in selecting items from the product backlog to be addressed during that Sprint.

**7. Development and Testing:** The team works on the development of selected functionalities during the Sprint. Raul Magaña, Mateo Ortiz, and Jimena Garcia collaborate on programming, testing, and quality assurance tasks.

## **Phase 4: Ongoing Review and Adaptation**
**8. Sprint Review Meeting:** At the end of each Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint review meeting. Raul Magaña, Mateo Ortiz, and Jimena Garcia present the completed work, discuss achievements, and collect feedback from the team.

**9. Retrospective Meeting:** Also at the end of each Sprint, a retrospective meeting is held. In this meeting, the team reflects on the process and seeks ways to improve collaboration and efficiency.

## **Phase 5: Product Delivery and Maintenance**
**10. Incremental Delivery:** As Sprints are completed, the product is delivered incrementally. The team works together to ensure that the delivered functionalities are of high quality and meet the requirements.

**11. Maintenance and Updates:** After the initial delivery, the team continues to provide support and makes periodic updates to address issues, add new features, and keep the system up to date.
In this development process, Scrum has been adapted to work in a context where there is no Product Owner, and the Scrum Master (Raul Magaña) leads the identification of objectives and manages the product backlog. The development team (Raul Magaña, Mateo Ortiz, and Jimena Garcia) collaboratively works on Sprint planning, development, and review, maintaining an agile focus on the incremental delivery of value to end-users. Retrospective meetings are essential for continuous process improvement and adaptation to changing project needs.

This agile development process, based on Scrum, allows the team to effectively adapt to changing needs and ensure that the product maintains a high standard of quality by using accurate and up-to-date information. The team's organization and defined roles facilitate collaboration and the incremental delivery of value to our users.
