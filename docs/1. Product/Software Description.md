In the current healthcare context, effective medication management is crucial to ensure the health and well-being of patients. With this goal in mind, we have embarked on the development of an innovative "Medication Management System." Our main objective is to significantly improve the user experience in administering their medications by providing accurate information and timely reminders about prescribed doses.

| *General Objective* |
|----------------------|
| Facilitate the management and accurate monitoring of medical treatments, improve medication adherence, guaranteeing proper use and contributing to the health of users through reliable medical information. |

# Project Description:

The "Medication Management System" we are developing is a comprehensive solution designed to empower users in managing their medical treatment. Below is a detailed description of how this system will transform the way people approach their health:

#### **Efficient Access to Crucial Information**:

Our system will provide users with easy and quick access to vital information about their medications. This will include details about doses, administration schedules, possible interactions, and side effects.

Users will be able to access this information anytime, anywhere through an intuitive mobile application or user-friendly web interface. They will no longer have to rely on messy paper records or consult multiple online sources for information about their medications.

#### **Comprehensive Historical Record**:

The system will allow users to maintain a complete and detailed historical record of the medications they have used in the past and those they are currently taking. This will be especially valuable for those who require long-term treatments or have multiple medical conditions.

This historical record will serve as an essential tool for patients, facilitating precise tracking of treatment evolution and enabling adjustments as needed.

#### **Personalized Reminders**:

Proper dose administration is essential for the effectiveness of any medical treatment. Our system will provide personalized and configurable reminders to ensure users never forget to take their medications on time.

These reminders will adapt to the specific needs of each user, taking into account schedules and doses. Alerts for missed doses will also be considered.

#### **Extensive PLM VADECUM Database**:

We will integrate an extensive PLM VADECUM database containing up-to-date information on a wide variety of medications. This will ensure that users have access to accurate and reliable data about their medications.

### **Project Scope**:

Development of a user-friendly interface for mobile and web applications.
Integration of the PLM VADECUM database to access detailed information about medications.
Implementation of a medication and dose tracking system.
Configuration of personalized reminders and notifications.
Development of a secure platform and protection of sensitive medical data.
Launch and distribution of the system through app stores and web platforms.

### Project Limitations:

The platform will not provide medical advice or diagnoses; this information should be obtained from a healthcare professional.
The accuracy of medication information will depend on the PLM VADECUM database and the updating of its contents.
The system does not replace medical consultation or direct medical supervision for serious medical conditions.
The availability and compatibility of the application may be limited by technical and hardware factors of users' devices.

In summary, the "Medication Management System" aims to revolutionize medication management, empowering users to take control of their health. It will provide access to crucial information, comprehensive historical records, and personalized reminders, all supported by an extensive PLM VADECUM database. However, it is important to consider the limitations and remember that this system does not substitute professional medical advice.
