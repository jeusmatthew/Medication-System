# Completed product changes

 During the last phases of development, strategic decisions were made that have resulted in substantial changes in the implementation of the product. The following are the most prominent modifications that have redefined the development strategy.

## Evidence 1: Transition of Development Tools

In a significant decision, the choice has been made to move away from the use of Flutterflow and Android Studio to a mobile application simulation. This choice involves the use of NetBeans and IntelliJ under the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This change aims to provide a more robust and adaptable framework for our development needs.

## Evidence 2: Refined and Focused Requirements

 Another key aspect of the project changes was the revision and reduction of the project's list of requirements. Initially, an extensive list of tasks was addressed, which, over time, has been consolidated into six key requirements. This more selective and focused approach not only simplifies project management, but also allows concentration on the implementation of the most critical and valuable features for the users.

## Evidence 3: Strategic Redesign of the Software Structure

 In addition to the simplification of requirements, the team has undertaken a comprehensive redesign of the software structure. Both class diagrams and use cases have been modularised to improve readability and development efficiency. This strategic adaptation not only facilitates the understanding of the system architecture, but also facilitates future expansions and enhancements.

## Evidence 4: Implementation of the MVC Pattern

 One step that has been taken is to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which provides a clearer separation of responsibilities within the code, improving the maintainability and scalability of the project. The demonstration of code under this approach provides a promising perspective on how software logic will be structured and managed in the future.
