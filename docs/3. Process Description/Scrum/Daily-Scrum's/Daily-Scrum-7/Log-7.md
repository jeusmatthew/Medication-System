## Day Summary:

Today the third sprint of the second part of the DoseWise project development started. The team met to discuss and share their progress.

At the sprint planning meeting, the roles and tasks to be performed by each team member were discussed.
It was decided to start with the following documentation and coding activities:

1. Creation of the database in Sqlite by hand.
2. The class diagram and the use cases were improved.

During the discussion, the team performed the first daily Scrum, it was concluded not to use Android Studio and webscrapping in order to make the project less complex and ready on time.

In the sprint review there were some errors and changes as the abstracted classes felt wrong, they started abstracting again.

In the Sprint Retrospective, the team decided to start with classes from the beginning, a better class diagram was defined as well as use cases.

**For the next Sprint:**

- A preview of the code for the functioning of the app will be available.
- The database and the code for manual data entry will be ready.

**Other Comments:**  It was agreed to hold the next Daily Scrum the next week at the same time.
