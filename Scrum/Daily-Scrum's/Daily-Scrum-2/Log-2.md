## Summary of the Day
Today marked the second day of the software development project. During the Sprint Planning meeting, the team discussed items from the product backlog and selected tasks for the upcoming sprint. The team decided to address the following:
1. Product description.
2. Comparison with similar software.
3. Project-specific differences.

During the Daily Scrum, the team shared progress on their tasks so far:
- Progress was made in determining functional and non-functional requirements.
- Similar software options were identified.

Despite the team's preparations, there were some obstacles in defining functional and non-functional requirements due to concerns about long-term implementation capacity due to lack of experience. It was agreed that the team will seek information and support to overcome this obstacle.

A Sprint Review was not conducted as the first product increment is not yet ready.

During today's Sprint Retrospective, the team discussed the need for better organization and agreed to schedule team-building sessions to improve productivity and team spirit.

## Commitments for the Next Sprint
- Complete the list of functional and non-functional requirements.
- Continue with the product description and research on similar software.

## Other Comments
