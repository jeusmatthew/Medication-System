## Daily Summary:
Today marked the fourth day of the software development project. During the Sprint Planning meeting, we discussed items from the product backlog and selected tasks for the upcoming sprint. The team decided to tackle the following:
1. Requirements section
2. Abstraction process
3. Progress presentation

In the Daily Scrum, the team shared updates on their tasks so far:
- Progress was made in creating the artifacts, and the abstraction process task was delegated to all team members.
- Sections for Product and Process have already been completed.

Despite the team's preparation, there were some obstacles encountered in working according to the agreed-upon dates. A Sprint Review was not conducted as the first product increment is not yet ready.

In today's Sprint Retrospective, the team discussed the completion of artifacts and began the final phase of the project.

**Commitments for the next sprint:**
- Completing the creation of artifacts.
- Starting a PowerPoint presentation.

**Other Comments:**
It was agreed to hold the next Daily Scrum tomorrow at the same time, along with the completion of each assigned task.
