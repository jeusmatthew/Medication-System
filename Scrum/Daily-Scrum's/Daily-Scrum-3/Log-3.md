## Daily Summary
Today marks the third day of the software development project. During the Sprint Planning meeting, elements of the product backlog were discussed, and tasks for the upcoming sprint were selected. The team decided to address the following:
1. Product description.
2. Value proposition.
3. Non-functional requirements.
4. Process description.

In the Daily Scrum, the team shared progress on their tasks so far:
- Progress was made in determining functional requirements, and non-functional ones were completed.
- The product description was finished, and progress was made with the value proposition.

Despite the team's preparation, some obstacles were encountered in defining functional requirements, and it was agreed that the team would seek information and focus on finalizing this first draft.

A Sprint Review was not conducted as the first product increment is not yet ready.

In today's Sprint Retrospective, the team discussed the completion of documentation, and other tasks were delegated, such as finalizing the value proposition and functional requirements.

## Commitments for the Next Sprint
- Functional requirements list will be completed.
- Continue with the value proposition and process description.

## Other Comments
It was agreed to hold the next Daily Scrum tomorrow at the same time, as well as the completion of each assigned task.
